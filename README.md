# music_quizzes

This project is for those who want to practice on introductory and intermediate music theory.
It includes multiple choice quizzes for preparatory, first, second, and third grade.

The `main.py` contains multiple choice dictionaries for each grade and the functions for generating a quiz.
The rest of the files (`preparatory.csv`, `first_grade.csv`, `second_grade.csv`, and `third_grade.csv`) 
contain the correct answer for every question included in the dictionaries.
